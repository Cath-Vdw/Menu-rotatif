        do? Who'd you diddle? You look like someone good with a gun. You look like someone who could shoot up an office.
        And I hope you are 'cuz I got a plan to get us out of this dump but I'm going to need some help, you think you
        can give me a hand? I need to get out to my daughter. The babysitter will kill me if I don't get back soon. Do
